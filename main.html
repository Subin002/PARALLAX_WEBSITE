                <p >Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it
                    like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans. Nature is indeed
                    God’s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of
                    all living beings on Earth. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the house we live
                    in is provided by nature. Nature is called ‘Mother Nature’ because just like our mother, she is
                    always nurturing us with all our needs. The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.

                <p>The earth and everything on it is a result of billions and billions of years of natural processes. Natural things are what keep us alive. The Earth’s atmosphere, gravity, life-giving properties in the soil, photosynthesis in plants, temperature regulation, oxygen production in oceans, water cycle which enables humans to drink clean water – all these are the result of natural processes.The mental, emotional, and physical health benefits of nature are well documented. From reducing stress and depression to improving heart health and memory, nature has something to offer everyone.

                    Nature can also help you avoid heart disease by lowering your stress level. Compared to urban exposure, nature experience is linked to substantial reductions in anxiety and improved mental health.
                    From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.</p>
